Poetry is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and will manage (install/update) them for you.

## Installing Poetry
For a more comprehensive and complete guide on Poetry installation, visit the official [documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation). Here you can find a lot more further information, such as troubleshooting tips and alternative installation options.

For this guide, we're sticking to the standard installs recommended by the developers.

### Linux, OSX etc.
For *nix systems - you can install Poetry by executing the following command in your preferred terminal:
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python -
```

### Windows

If you're using Windows, you're able to install Poetry by using PowerShell:
```bash
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py -UseBasicParsing).Content | python -
```
> Poetry automatically picks up the current Python version on your machine and will use it to `create virtualenvs` accordingly.

<br /><br />

To verify if poetry has been installed correctly, check the version by running:
```bash
poetry --version
```

## Creating Our First Project
Once we have Poetry installed, we can begin creating our first Poetry initialised project. To do so, simply use:
```
poetry new our-first-project --src
```

> I'm using the name `our-first-project` as an example for this post, but feel free to pick your own. <br /><br />
> Using the `--src` flag also ensures that Poetry creates our project inside a `./src` folder.

<br />

This generates some boilerplate content with the following project tree structure:
```bash
our-first-project
├── src
│   └── __init__.py
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.rst
└── tests
    ├── __init__.py
    └── test_our_first_project.py
```

Pretty conventional stuff, but the most notable file here is `pyproject.toml`.

This is the file Poetry uses to orchestrate and keep track of our project's info, the version of Python we're using, our development dependencies and other external packages.

## Initialising Pre-Existing Projects
Poetry can also be used to initialise a pre-populated directory.
```bash
cd pre-existing-project
poetry init
```

Then we simply use `poetry install` to create a virtual environment and install all existing dependencies.

## Specifying Dependencies
Now we have a project setup, we can start specifying the dependencies our project will use.

### Adding New Dependencies
To add a new dependency, we can use the `poetry add` command.

This writes the package to `pyproject.toml`, creates and writes to a package lock file (`poetry.lock`) and installs the package to our new virtual environment, which Poetry will create if one isn't already active.
```
poetry add pandas
```

We're also able to manually edit the `pyproject.toml` file to specify new dependencies under the `tool.poetry.dependencies` section, then using `poetry install` to install them.
```
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.8"
pandas = "^1.4.2"
```

<br />

### Removing Existing Dependencies
If you'd like to remove a dependency - it's as simple as using `poetry remove`.

Again, this will remove the dependency(s) from the package files - and clean up any other unused dependencies of that dependency.
```
poetry remove pandas
```

You're also able to add/remove multiple dependencies at once by simply adding them in a sequence.
```
poetry remove pandas numpy
```

<br />

### Updating Dependencies
To update your dependencies, use `poetry update`:
```
poetry update pandas
```

This'll fetch and update all your dependencies to their latest versions (according to your `pyproject.toml` file) amd overwrites the `poetry.lock` file keeping your project up to date.
