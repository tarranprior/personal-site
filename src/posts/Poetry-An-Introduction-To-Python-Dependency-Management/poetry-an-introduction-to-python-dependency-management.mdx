Poetry is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and will manage (install/update) them for you.

## Installing Poetry
For a more comprehensive and complete guide on Poetry installation, visit the official [documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation). Here you can find a lot more further information, such as troubleshooting tips and alternative installation options.

For this guide, we're sticking to the standard installs recommended by the developers.

### Linux, OSX etc.
For *nix systems - you can install Poetry by executing the following command in your preferred terminal:
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python -
```

### Windows

If you're using Windows, you're able to install Poetry by using PowerShell:
```bash
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py -UseBasicParsing).Content | python -
```
> Poetry automatically picks up the current Python version on your machine and will use it to `create virtualenvs` accordingly.

<br /><br />

To verify if poetry has been installed correctly, check the version by running:
```bash
poetry --version
```

## Creating Our First Project
Once we have Poetry installed, we can begin creating our first Poetry initialised project. To do so, simply use:
```
poetry new our-first-project --src
```

> I'm using the name `our-first-project` as an example for this post, but feel free to pick your own. <br /><br />
> Using the `--src` flag also ensures that Poetry creates our project inside a `./src` folder.

<br />

This generates some boilerplate content with the following project tree structure:
```bash
our-first-project
├── src
│   └── __init__.py
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.rst
└── tests
    ├── __init__.py
    └── test_our_first_project.py
```

Pretty conventional stuff, but the most notable file here is `pyproject.toml`.

This is the file Poetry uses to orchestrate and keep track of our project's info, the version of Python we're using, our development dependencies and other external packages.

## Initialising Pre-Existing Projects
Poetry can also be used to initialise a pre-populated directory.
```bash
cd pre-existing-project
poetry init
```

Then we simply use `poetry install` to create a virtual environment and install all existing dependencies.

## Specifying Dependencies
Now we have a project setup, we can start specifying the dependencies our project will use.

### Adding New Dependencies
To add a new dependency, we can use the `poetry add` command.

This writes the package to `pyproject.toml`, creates and writes to a package lock file (`poetry.lock`) and installs the package to our new virtual environment, which Poetry will create if one isn't already active.
```
poetry add pandas
```

We're also able to manually edit the `pyproject.toml` file to specify new dependencies under the `tool.poetry.dependencies` section, then using `poetry install` to install them.
```
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.8"
pandas = "^1.4.2"
```

<br />

### Removing Existing Dependencies
If you'd like to remove a dependency - it's as simple as using `poetry remove`.

Again, this will remove the dependency(s) from the package files - and clean up any other unused dependencies of that dependency.
```
poetry remove pandas
```

You're also able to add/remove multiple dependencies at once by simply adding them in a sequence.
```
poetry remove pandas numpy
```

<br />

### Updating Dependencies
To update your dependencies, use `poetry update`:
```
poetry update pandas
```

This'll fetch and update all your dependencies to their latest versions (according to your `pyproject.toml` file) amd overwrites the `poetry.lock` file keeping your project up to date.

## Conclusion
You now know the basics of Poetry and dependency management in Python, and ready to use it with your projects. Since learning Poetry, I've been using it for 99% of my Python development - so it's definitely something I recommend if you're having any doubts!

Poetry can also help you build and upload your package. We've only covered the basics in this post, but I've included some further resources below if you want to learn more about Poetry and its features.
