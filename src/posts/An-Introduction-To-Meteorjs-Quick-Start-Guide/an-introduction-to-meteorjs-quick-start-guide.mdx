![Meteor](./meteor-feature.png)

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (Latest Version)

## Installation
To install Meteor on *nix systems, you can use this simple one-liner:
```bash
curl https://install.meteor.com/ | sh
```

If you're using a Windows machine, see [this guide](https://tarranprior.com/writing/how-to-install-meteorjs-using-chocolatey-windoze).<br/>
> As of version 2.4, you're able to install Meteor as an npm!<br/>Use `npm install -g meteor` for a seamless install (Node.js is required.)<br/><br/>You can find more information @ the official [docs](https://docs.meteor.com/install.html#installation).

## Create Meteor Project
Now that we've got Meteor installed, let's start by creating a simple application with some boilerplate code, and see what's included with a fresh-out-the-box project.

To create a new project, simply run:
```bash
meteor create <project name>
```

Next, install the dependencies and fire up the development server to run the app locally:
```bash
cd <project name>
meteor npm install
meteor
# Meteor server running on: http://localhost:3000/
```

This will generate and install all of the necessary files required to run your application.

> Meteor comes with npm bundled so that you can type `meteor npm` without worrying about installing it yourself. If you like, you can also use a globally installed npm to manage your packages.

<br/>

Once complete, you'll see the following output:
```
=> Started proxy.
=> Started MongoDB.
=> Started your app.

=> App running at: http://localhost:3000/
   Type Control-C twice to stop.
```

Our app is running! Meteor uses port 3000 by default, so we can go to localhost:3000 in our browser to see it in action.

> If you'd like to change the default port for your app, you can use `meteor -p <xxxx>`.

### Troubleshooting
If your app gets stuck or doesn't appear to be updating (particularly when installing npm dependencies) - perform the following: 
- In the same console, hit `Ctrl + C` to cancel the job. If this doesn't work, close the window.
- Open a new console and navigate to your app directory. Meteor creates all the necessary project files before the operation completes, so everything should still be intact.
- Run `meteor npm install`.
- Lastly, run `meteor` or `meteor run` to start up the development server.

## Application Structure

### What's In The Box?
So what do we get with a fresh, barebones Meteor project? Let's take a look at the project's directory.
```bash
.meteor/
client/
node_modules/
server/
tests/
.gitignore
package.json
package-lock.json
```

There are two notable folders here. Namely, the `client/` and `server/` folders. Let's break them down.

### Client
In the client folder, we have all of our client-side code. As the name implies, these files are exclusive to the client, and include your basic front-end stuff like markup and styles.
```bash
client/
  main.css
  main.html
  main.js
```

### Server
Similarly, the `server/` directory contains files that are only available on the server.
```bash
server/
  main.js
```
