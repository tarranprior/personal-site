I wrote this post back in 2016 *ish* when I was super into **web and digital design**, and decided to throw it back online since it was a pretty *handy-dandy* list to have in the bookmarks, and also nice for preservation purposes.

Then I thought it might be fun to revisit them, and see which sites are still up and running so I can update the list. Turns out, all of them - over five years later!

So, to keep things fresh (*and colourful, har har har*) I've added an additional **twenty** entries which cover the latest colour tools on the interwebs in 2022.

Let's explore some colour!

## 1 - Coolors
[Coolors](https://coolors.co) is a light, responsive and super-fast online tool for generating colour schemes fast. You can [create](https://coolors.co/aaaaaa-bbbbbb-cccccc-dddddd-eeeeee), save, share and [explore](https://coolors.co/palettes/trending) colour palettes in seconds by using Coolors' neat interface.

## 2 - Adobe Color
Bragging thousands of colour schemes, [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/explore) (previously Adobe Color CC) is a real gem to designers.

There's a huge catalogue of schemes to choose from, and the site is equipped with a bunch of useful tools including a [colour generation tool](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel), allowing users to create and save schemes based on colour rules.
