One of the most efficient and straight-forward ways to format dates in Gatsby is at query-time, using Gatsby's built-in GraphQL data layer.

```javascript
{
    date(formatString: "MMMM Do, YYYY")
}
```

How does this work? Under the hood, Gatsby relies on [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/string-format/) to format dates. This "cleanses" and converts strings to date objects, and allows us to add parsing tokens to our queries.

These parsing tokens can be thought of as a set of syntax rules, or more accurately - structured markup, which determines how our date string will be formatted.

<br />

> *Note: Parsing tokens are case-sensitive*.

<br />

For example, let's say we want to display the publish date of a blog post. Each post is written in markdown with a frontmatter variable called `date`, and a value that follows this format: "2021-01-01 01:00".

Using the query above, we get the following output:

```
January 1st, 2021
```

## Days

Looking at the [docs](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/parsing/string-format/), there's also a token for displaying the day name, set by `moment.locale()`.

```javascript
{
    date(formatString: "dddd MMMM Do, YYYY")
}
```

This gives us the following result:

```
Friday January 1st, 2021
```

## Timestamps

Lastly, to add the timestamp, we can add the `hh:mma` token to our query.

```javascript
{
    date(formatString: "dddd MMMM Do, YYYY hh:mma")
}
```

Resulting in the following output:

```
January 1st, 2021 01:00am
```
